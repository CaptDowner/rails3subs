Please backup all directories and files beneath the current one before excuting this gem 
as it will make changes that are not easily reversible. What this means is that you'll 
have to make changes to an Array of Arrays in the source code (currently named SUB_STRS) 
to reverse all changes made by executing this gem. 

This gem is designed to update older Rails projects to be Rails 3 compatible.
Execution of this gem does not do a complete update, as there are many other issues to deal with.
All of the Rails 2 deprecated strings and methods are replaced by their newer Rails 3 counterparts.

This is a work in progress, and as Rails 3 evolves, there may be additional deprecations and changes 
that could require additional work. My goal is to keep this updated as frequently as my time allows, 
but there are no guarantees that this version handles the latest Rails 3 revisions.

Hopefully, rails3-subs can help you as you transition your older Rails projects to work with Rails 3.
